If you download this repo you have to download another referenced repos too, for some of them you can install [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Lupusa87) packages instead.


For now best performance has Chrome, you can look at [demo](https://lupblazordemos.z13.web.core.windows.net/).

All activities, contributions are welcome, I am open for bussines/result oriented communication.

I realize that today my code is worse than it will be tommorow :)
